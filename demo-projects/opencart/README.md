# OpenCart
------
**This is NOT meant for production purposes!!**
This should work with all OS as long as you have docker and docker compose installed.  Please report any issues you face and I'll take a look as soon as I can.

-------

### What does it do?
Generates a docker app with the latest version of OpenCart 3. This helps anyone testing an extension or just wanting to play around with a test OpenCart 3 site.

### How do I monitor the app created?
I personally use docker desktop but you can use portainer or any other docker monitoring system you want!

### Start OpenCart
Select the version from the dropdown and click on the "up" button below to create the app.
